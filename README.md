Callen Jolley
Developing Team Lead @ Walmart1878 

Hello, my name is Callen Jolley. I am a current training lead with 2 years of experience in retail at Walmart and 3 years of management experience I specialize in scheduling, operational management and analysis, and performance improvement. I have a strong background in team management, problem resolution, and store operations.

Throughout my career, I have worked on piloting new systems, improving operations through process changes, and leading new initiatives to align the department's work with the company's values. I am passionate about driving digital transformation, fostering team collaboration, and delivering customer satisfaction. 

In my previous roles, I successfully led teams of 30 to 40 to break store sales records, led through store renovations and helped pilot new methods for operations. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of my expertise.

I believe in a respect-driven approach, and fostering an environment where collaboration is key to success. Business is like a machine, all the parts need to be well-oiled and performing for the machine to operate at maximum performance. I am excited to connect and explore opportunities to contribute and grow alongside like-minded professionals.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss potential collaborations or share insights.

I am proficient in Python and C++, with hands-on in-class experience in developing software solutions, automating processes, and implementing algorithms. My skill set includes writing efficient, modular code and applying these languages to various applications, such as data analysis, machine learning, and performance-critical systems. I am currently working on developing my skills in databases.

I am currently working on creating a website for a future dream my wife and I share of owning a wedding venue business. While it’s still in development, I’m excited about the direction it’s heading and the opportunity to bring our vision to life through this project.
